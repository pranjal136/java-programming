/*
 * The Point class is used for representing a point with two coordinates.
Implement the class Point based on the class diagram and description given below.

Method Description:- 

- Point(double xCoordinate , double yCoordinate )

* Initialize the instance variables xCoordinate and yCoordinate appropriately 
* with the values passed to the constructor.

- calculateDistance()

* Calculate and return the distance of the point from the origin (0,0). 
* The distance can be calculated using the formula given below. 
* The distance should be rounded off to 2 decimal digits.
     distance=âˆš((x2-x1)2+(y2-y1)2), where x1 and x2 are values of x-coordinates 
     of two points and y1 and y2 are values of y-coordinates of two points

- calculateDistance(Point point)

* Calculate and return the distance of the point from the 'point' passed to the method. 
* The distance should be rounded off to 2 decimal digits.

#Hints
* Use Math.sqrt(double d) method to calculate the square root
* Use Math.round(double d) method to round off the values
* Implement the getter and setter methods appropriately.
Test the functionalities using the provided Tester class.
